* fixed a string in german translation
* fixed selecting file in TMD-Viewer
* only install qm-files for translation, not ts-files aswell
* changed default directory to $HOME (so that file-selectors
  don't start at Qwads source or installation directory)
* add command line options:
  -h / --help 		= show help
  -v / --version	= show Qwad version and exit
  -d / --download	= download IOS (see examples below)
  -g / --getversions	= get available versions of given IOS
  -c / --convert	= convert IOS name to hex (and vice versa)
  ======================================================================
  Examples (no batch-support):

  **Download**
  qwad -d <IOS>            <VERSION> <OUTPUT>       <DECRYPT> <PACK>
  qwad -d IOS58            6176      $PWD/IOS58.wad False     True
  qwad -d 000000010000003a 6176      $PWD/IOS58.wad True      False
  >> Result: IOS58.wad

  **GetVersions**
  qwad -g <IOS>
  qwad -g IOS9
  qwad -g 0000000100000009
  >> Result: Available Versions for IOS9: 520, 521, 778, 1034

  **Convert**
  qwad -c <IOS>
  qwad -c IOS36
  qwad -c 0000000100000024
  >> Result: IOS36 == 0000000100000024
